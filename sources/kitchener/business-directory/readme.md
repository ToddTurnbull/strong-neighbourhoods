## Notes
Categorie(s):

* Shopping: Personal and Household
    * Select businesses with primary NAICS sector as 44-45: Retail trade, or those where profile starts with 'RETAIL', ‘Retail’ or ‘Sell’

* Community facilities: Healthcare
    * Profile descriptions of 'Health & Wellbeing' or 'Health & Wellness'

Issues: 

* Directory includes many businesses, but not comprehesive, especially for businesses outside of downtown, e.g. cannot find businesses offering bowling, pool or other such entertainment)

* City of Waterloo does not publish such a directory as open data, so may not be able to use it unless we can gather data for retail businesses in Waterloo, e.g. from their online business directory.

Potential uses:

* for display on map 
* calculations, e.g. shopping points per square km within a planning district
